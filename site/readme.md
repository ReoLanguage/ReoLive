Site information
================

This folder has the key static html and JavaScript files of this project.
It uses symbolic links, created by the script `../compile.sh`, to:
 - include up-to-date JavaScript files, generated by this project, and
 - be used by the `../server` when the local server is running.


How to run the framework
=====

* For the static version (which also includes tabs to access the server), open the `index.html` file, after running `../compile.sh` script to compile and generate the needed symbolic links.

> sh ../compile.sh
> open localJS/src/main/resources/index.html

* For the server-based version, start the server using sbt and open localhost:9000

> sbt server/run
> open http://localhost:9000


Difference between Site and Snapshot
====================================
This folder includes html files that are used during development, and uses symbolic links to keep the JS files up-to-date. It is used by the server via symbolic links as well.

The snapshot folder includes copies of a version of the project, that are periodically updated and included in the Git repository, and include references to only the static JS (which does not rely on the server). 


This folder includes most content from the Snapshot, except:
 - index.html, content/*.html - to refer to the fast-compiled generated JS files
 - js/ - to use symbolic links instead of hard copies of the generated JS
